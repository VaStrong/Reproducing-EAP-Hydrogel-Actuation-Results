# Reproducing-EAP-Hydrogel-Actuation-Results
This repository contains all code and data used within the experiments described in chapter 3 of the thesis “Soft Computation Using Electroactive Polymer Hydrogels”. All data analysis was performed using code written in the Matlab environment, using Matlab packages, and datasets constructed in Matlab. This repository is available on Zenodo. 

## Matlab
* "data.mat" - This holds the recorded current data along with the generated coefficients.

* "RelaxPlot.m" - Generates plot of hydrogel motion over time when stimulation is removed.
* "StimPlot.m" - Generates plot of hydrogel motion over time when stimulation is applied.
